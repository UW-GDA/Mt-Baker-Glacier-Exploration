Workflow utilizing SNOTEL data and Landsat imagery to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate changes in snow and ice cover on Mt. Baker over time.



## Background Information

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/UW-GDA/When-Glaciers-Were-Cool/blob/main/final-project/snotel_rgi.jpg" width="40%" height="40%">

Mount Baker is a 10,781 ft glacier-covered stratovolcano in Washingtonâ€™s North Cascades with 1.79 km3 of volumetric snow and ice cover. Mount Baker has sixteen named glaciers, the largest being the Coleman Glacier with a surface area of 5.2 km2. For this workflow, the Talum Glaciers are considered to be one glacier.

Glacial mass balance is dependent on snow accumulation and snow melt. At higher elevations, snowfall in the accumulation zone becomes glacier ice over time. At lower elevations, winter snow and glacier ice melt in the ablation zone. Between the accumulation and ablation zones, an equilibrium line can be determined to assess how a glacier is advancing or receding. Glaciers are susceptible to changes in precipitation and temperature, and physical changes over time are therefore an important indicator of climate change.

Four SNOTEL stations surround Mt. Baker:
  * SNOTEL:909_WA_SNTL, Elev. 4,030 ft  
  * SNOTEL:910_WA_SNTL, Elev. 3,040 ft  
  * SNOTEL:999_WA_SNTL, Elev. 3,520 ft  
  * SNOTEL:1011_WA_SNTL, Elev. 4,970 ft  


## Objectives

To evaluate glacial trends over time both quantitatively and qualitatively, and to explore the relationship between SNOTEL station data and glacial mass on Mt. Baker.  
  
Use Landsat imagery to visualize the glacial accumulation zone and ablation zone, and establish an equilibrium line.   
Is the equilibrium line advancing or receding over time?

Use SNOTEL datasets from the four stations at Mount Baker to build an annual snow accumulation and snowmelt timeseries.  
Is this consistent with accumulation and ablation observed from Landsat imagery? 


## Tools/Packages

* Rasterio  
* Numpy  
* Scipy
* Matplotlib  
* Geopandas

## Data Downloads and Initial Set Up

#### SNOTEL ```/final-project/snotel_stats.ipynb```
Download daily snow water equivalent measurements from the four SNOTEL stations and 

#### Landsat Imagery ```/final-project/LS8_download```
Use dates from SNOTEL analysis to narrow annual search window and download cloud-free imagery for the start, peak, and end of the annual snowpack. *Availability of cloud-free imagery given specific dates was the most limiting factor in this analysis.*  

#### Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) ```/final-project/rgi_download.ipynb```
Download the WesternCanadaUS.shp shapefile from RGI and establish an area of interest coordinate box surrounding the extents of Mt. Baker.  
Filter for all named glaciers intersecting the area of interest. This yeilds 14 glaciers (the Talum Glaciers are one polygon). 
Save final geodataframe as a GeoJSON for future analysis.

## Methodology

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A(SNOTEL Daily SWE <br/>per station) --> B(Start/Peak/End Date <br/>per station per water year) --> C(Landsat Imagery Search <br/>given SNOTEL dates) --> D(Develop NDSI/Snow Mask <br/> plots) --> E(Clip NDSI/Snow Mask <br/>to RGI glacier geom extents <br/>for snow covered area caluclations)
```

#### SNOTEL ```/final-project/snotel_stats.ipynb```
Caluclate the water year and day of water year for each data point and determine the start, peak, and end of the annual (water year) snowpack.  
* Start: Last day of 0" SWE during accumulation period  
* Peak: Day of maximum SWE  
* End: First day of 0" SWE during melt period

Shifts in the start/peak/end dates can be indicators of the snowpack's response to climate change. This can indicate shorter accumulation periods, faster melting periods, ...

Develop a time series at each station for start, peak, and end of the annual (water year) snowpack. Calculate the linear regression for each time series and observe any trends in the datasets.  

#### Landsat Imagery NOTEBOOK
Because there is so much variation between the locations/elevations of the SNOTEL stations and the extents of the glaciers on Mt. Baker, Landsat imagery allows for analysis to be conducted on glacial snow and ice.

## Future Work

### Equilibrium Extents

### Accumulation and Melt Period Per Aspect
*North versus south facing glaciers and associated SNOTEL stations.*    
* Explore Sentinel-2 satellite imagery alternative: 5-day resolution starts around 2017.  
* Determine an appropriate 'buffer' around the RGI glacier geom to capture approximate extent of ablation zone. Use new geometry to clip NDSI/snow mask plots and measure loss of snow covered area over time to calculate the melt rate.  
* Compare to melt rate calculated via SNOTEL daily SWE measurements.  
* Include temperature and precipitation time series. 

## Future Development
Devlop user-friendly workflows that can deliver a standalone presentation of results.  
* Current workflow lacks documentation/instruction and is best presented by exporting results to a new notebook or to an external platform such as powerpoint.  
* Landsat Analysis notebooks are inefficient when applied to larger volumes of imagery.
